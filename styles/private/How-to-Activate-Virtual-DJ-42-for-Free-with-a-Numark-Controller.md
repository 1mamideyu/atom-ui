Virtual DJ is one of the most popular DJ software programs in the world, with over 100 million downloads. It allows you to mix and scratch music, videos and karaoke on your computer or mobile device. It also has a lot of features and effects to enhance your performance.
 
However, some Numark controllers include a limited edition (LE) version of Virtual DJ 4.2, which requires activation with a serial number. This serial number is different from the one that comes with your controller, and you need to get it from the Virtual DJ website.
 
If you don't activate your Virtual DJ 4.2 LE, you will be locked out of the software after 30 days of trial. You will also not be able to access some of the advanced features and content that are available for the full version.
 
So how do you activate your Virtual DJ 4.2 LE for free with your Numark controller? Here are the steps:
 
1. Go to [https://www.virtualdj.com/le/](https://www.virtualdj.com/le/) and enter your LE serial number. This is the one that came with your Numark controller, not the one that came with Virtual DJ 4.2.
2. Select your Numark controller model from the list and click on "Download". This will download the full version of Virtual DJ 4.2 that is compatible with your controller.
3. Install Virtual DJ 4.2 on your computer and run it. You will be asked to enter your email address and create a password for your Virtual DJ account.
4. Once you log in, you will see a message that says "Your license has been activated". Congratulations! You can now use Virtual DJ 4.2 for free with your Numark controller.

If you have any questions or problems with activating your Virtual DJ 4.2 LE, you can visit the [Virtual DJ forums](https://www.virtualdj.com/forums/) and get help from other users or moderators.
